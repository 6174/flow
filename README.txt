 a few things:

drawing the boxes too much: text should be html (?)
 plotting is inefficient, also really bad
  renamable boxes

math should happen more than drawing
 error catching custom box

Everything should be abstracted, modularized...
  so we can add, remove, duplicate, etc.
math could probably more efficient

 figure out a good way to serialise the sketch, for load/save/persistence

hover ports for value?
 color things semantically

a good way to edit i/o ports

  blocks:
simple math block
filter
linear diffEQ
UI (button, check, slider, wheel...

some kind of network link?

ARDUINO?!

data types: beat? color? image? audio?
 
 rendering screes, for graphics, who knows; webGL?

MACRO PATCHES :G waat?!

play/pause, framerate, etc controls?

data import/export
